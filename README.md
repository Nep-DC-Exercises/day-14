# More CSS & Intro to JS

### Date: 9/17/19

### Summary

We continued our practice with CSS and were introduced to JavaScript. The pinterest-responsive folder contains my flexbox css work. I think it fulfills the requirements of the assignment but I think it still needs work. The javascript101 folder contains the javascript files from todays exercises.
